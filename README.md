# odin-recipes

This project will cover the basics of HTML and demonstrate my ability to create the structure of a website. The website will be a compiled list of recipes with links to different webpages in the site that will focus on each individual recipe. 

Structurally the website will include...

1. Homepage
2. 3-5 separate pages for an in depth look at the individual listed recipes
