        <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>Butter chicken is prepared with marinated chicken that's first grilled and then served in a rich gravy (a.k.a. curry) made with tomato, butter, and a special spice blend as a base.</p>
            <p>Unlike most Indian curries where the preparation of the base starts with a blend of onion and a ginger garlic paste cooked in oil, butter chicken uses tomato as a base and is cooked in butter, giving it a slightly sweet flavor. Cashews and almonds add to the sweetness and richness of the dish.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
                <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
                <li>1 medium onion diced</li>
                <li>1 tsp fresh ginger finely minced or grated (or use paste)</li>
                <li>2-3 cloves garlic finely minced or crushed</li>
                <li>1<sup>1/2</sup> pounds (about 2-3) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 3/4-inch chunks</li>
                <li>4 tbsp tomato paste or 8 oz can of tomato sauce</li>
                <li>1 tbsp garam masala</li>
                <li>1 tsp chili powder or paprika, adjust to taste</li>
                <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>Hot cooked rice and naan for serving</li>
                <li>(Optional) 1 tsp Fenugreek</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a large skillet or medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the oil, butter, and onions and cook onions down until lightly golden, about 3-4 minutes. Add ginger and garlic and let cook for 30 seconds, stirring so it doesnâ€™t burn.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken, tomato paste, and spices. Cook for 5-6 minutes or until everything is cooked through.</li>
                <li>Add the heavy cream and simmer for 8-10 minutes stirring occasionally. Serve over Basmati rice or with naan.</li>
            </ol>
