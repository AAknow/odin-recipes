        <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>This Cajun Shrimp Pasta dinner recipe has everything you could possibly want. Tender and succulent shrimp is coated in the cajun seasoning which adds just the right amount of flavor. The cream sauce only takes a few minutes to come together and the pasta soaks up all the flavor.</p>
            <p>Since this recipe is rich and heavy, this pasta dish is wonderful with vegetables of some kind. Either a healthy green salad or a side of steamed broccoli or spinach goes great with this dinner. The Cajun Shrimp Pasta has so much flavor the vegetable side dish you choose should be simple and light to help balance everything out.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tbsp kosher salt</li>
                <li>8 oz penne pasta</li>
                <li>1 lbs raw shrimp (deveined, cleaned, tail removed)
                <li>2 tbsp cajun seasoning</li>
                <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>1/2 cup parmesan cheese (finely grated from a block (a microplane works best); pre-grated or not real authentic parmesan won't melt as nicely)</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Add salt to pot of water and bring to a boil. Cook pasta to al dente doneness. Before draining, scoop out at least Â½ cup of the cooking water. Drain pasta and set aside.</li>
                <li>While the pasta is cooking, cook the shrimp and sauce. Combine shrimp with cajun seasoning and olive oil in bowl. Toss to combine.</li>
                <li>Heat large skillet over medium high heat. Add butter and melt. Add shrimp in a single layer and cook until golden brown on each side, turning only once. You may have to cook shrimp in two batches to allow enough room. Once done cooking, transfer cooked shrimp to a clean plate and reduce heat to medium low.</li>
                <li>Add heavy cream to pan and scrape bottoms to release any food that is stuck to the bottom. Allow cream to bubble. Reduce heat to low and stir in parmesan cheese to melt. Add cooked pasta and shrimp and stir to coat. If sauce needs to be thinned, add pasta water, one tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency is achieved.</li>
            </ol>
