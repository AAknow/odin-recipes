        <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>This Cajun Shrimp Pasta dinner recipe has everything you could possibly want. Tender and succulent shrimp is coated in the cajun seasoning which adds just the right amount of flavor. The cream sauce only takes a few minutes to come together and the pasta soaks up all the flavor.</p>
            <p>Since this recipe is rich and heavy, this pasta dish is wonderful with vegetables of some kind. Either a healthy green salad or a side of steamed broccoli or spinach goes great with this dinner. The Cajun Shrimp Pasta has so much flavor the vegetable side dish you choose should be simple and light to help balance everything out.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tbsp kosher salt</li>
                <li>8 oz penne pasta</li>
                <li>1 lbs raw shrimp (deveined, cleaned, tail removed)
                <li>2 tbsp cajun seasoning (*see note below, use this quantity if making my homemade seasoning blend; may turn out too salty if using store bought)</li>
                <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>1/2 cup parmesan cheese (finely grated from a block (a microplane works best); pre-grated or not real authentic parmesan won't melt as nicely)</li>
            </ul>
