    <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <h4><em>To Make The Stir Fry</em></h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook noodles al dente according to package instructions.  Strain, drizzle with a bit of oil, and toss to combine.  Set aside until ready to use.
                <li>While the noodles are being prepared, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large sauté pan or wok over medium-high heat.  Season chicken evenly with a few pinches of salt and pepper, then add it to the pan.  Cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink inside.  Transfer the chicken to a clean plate with a slotted spoon, and set aside.
                <li>Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pan, along with the onion and mushrooms.  Sauté for 4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft.  Add the zucchini* and garlic and sauté for 2 more minutes, stirring occasionally.
                <li>Stir in the Kung Pao Sauce, cooked chicken and rice noodles, and toss until everything is evenly combined.  Cook for 1 more minute until it comes to a simmer.
                <li>Remove from heat and serve immediately, garnished with your desired toppings.
            </ol>
        <h4><em>To Make The Kung Pao Sauce</em></h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk all ingredients together in a small bowl until combined.  If you would like a spicier sauce, add an extra tablespoon or two of the chili garlic sauce.</li>
            </ol>
